# VesselVision-Net
An AI-Driven Transformer Framework for Hepatic Vessel Segmentation in Contrast-Enhanced CT Images

#Overview
VesselVision-Net is a deep learning-based framework designed for the accurate segmentation of hepatic vessels â€” including the portal vein, and hepatic vein â€” from contrast-enhanced abdominal CT images. This model aims to support liver surgery pre-planning, enabling precise visualization and decision-making.

#Features
Transformer-based 3D architecture optimized for liver vessel segmentation
Handles multiple vessel types in a multi-label fashion
Suitable for use with contrast-enhanced single or multi-phase CT scans
High accuracy and generalizability on real-world annotated datasets

#Applications
Liver surgery pre-operative planning
3D reconstruction and visualization of hepatic vasculature
Educational and simulation-based tools for radiologists and surgeons

#Dataset
